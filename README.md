Hello and welcome, 

In 2021, I enrolled myself in a full-time data science course and travelled from Madhya Pradesh to Tamil Nadu to start my life as a hosteller. And now it has been 6 months for this new phase - new place part of my life. 

Although not an expert, I surely know a little more about the umbrella term 'data science'. So far, I have developed theoretical understanding of linear algebra, probability distributions, hypothesis testing, and ML algorithms namely, Apriori, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors, K-Means, among others. I have completed an EDA project on the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) in a team of 3, and a micro-EDA assignment on COVID-19 dataset. 

Over the past few months, I have noted my developing interest in machine learning and a growing enthusiasm for image analysis (the seed for which was planted during a blind shot in MANTHAN 2020, a national level hackathon, on the theme of Suspicious Activity Identification and Facial Recognition). While decluttering and delegating have emerged as my strengths besides communication, I realized I need to work on time management to keep a balance between work and life. 

Although still on my learning curve, I feel the urge to take on a role where I can not only use but also expand my existing set of knowledge and skills. If you are in a position to provide me such an opportunity, I humbly invite you to contact me. 

Thank you for visiting my profile!
