Hello and welcome, 

In 2021, I enrolled myself in a full-time data science course and travelled from Madhya Pradesh to Tamil Nadu to start my life as a hosteller. Although not an expert, I surely know a little more about the umbrella term 'data science'. 

So far, I have developed understanding of concepts like linear algebra, probability distributions, hypothesis testing, and data mining algorithms namely, Apriori, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors, K-Means, among others. I have completed an <a href='https://github.com/Tritika/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-'>EDA project on the Global Terrorism Database (GTD)</a> in a team of 3, a <a href='https://github.com/Tritika/Assignments/blob/main/EDA_Cowin-checkpoint.ipynb'>micro-EDA assignment on COVID-19 dataset</a>, and an <a href='https://github.com/Tritika/Equity-Portfolio-Miniature-Model'>Equity Generation Potfolio: Miniature Model</a> along with a peer. I also have a long running history with <a href='https://github.com/Tritika/Recommender-Systems'>recommendation systems</a>. I am still on my learning curve and have recently added Power BI in my set of skills. It is actually pretty fun ngl! 

Check out my projects and assignments. Head over to my linkedin and see what I've been up to. 

I also have an instagram page where I encourage the spread of individualism. I basically talk to people and then document my conversation with them as an IG Post. You can check that out over here: <a href = 'https://www.instagram.com/nosnoozezone/'>NoSnoozeZone</a> 

See anything you like? Let's connect!

Glad to have you here!
