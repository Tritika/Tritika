Hello and welcome, 

In 2021, I enrolled myself in a full-time data science course and travelled from Madhya Pradesh to Tamil Nadu to start my life as a hosteller. Although not an expert, I surely know a little more about the umbrella term 'data science'. 

So far, I have developed understanding of concepts like linear algebra, probability distributions, hypothesis testing, and data mining algorithms namely, Apriori, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors, K-Means, among others. I have completed an <a href='https://github.com/Tritika/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-'>EDA project on the Global Terrorism Database (GTD)</a> in a team of 3, a <a href='https://github.com/Tritika/Assignments/blob/main/EDA_Cowin-checkpoint.ipynb'>micro-EDA assignment on COVID-19 dataset</a>, and an <a href='https://github.com/Tritika/Equity-Portfolio-Miniature-Model'>Equity Generation Potfolio: Miniature Model</a> along with a peer. I also have a long running history with <a href='https://github.com/Tritika/Recommender-Systems'>recommendation systems</a>. I am still on my learning curve and have recently added <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tiwari-ritika_sales-insights-for-atliq-hardware-using-power-activity-7063849261955743745-om1g?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop'>Power BI</a> in my set of skills. It is actually pretty fun ngl! 

Check out my projects and assignments. Head over to my linkedin and see what I've been up to. 

I also have an instagram page where I encourage the spread of individualism. I basically talk to people and then document my conversation with them as an IG Post. You can check that out over here: <a href = 'https://www.instagram.com/nosnoozezone/'>NoSnoozeZone</a> 

See anything you like? Let's connect!

Glad to have you here!
